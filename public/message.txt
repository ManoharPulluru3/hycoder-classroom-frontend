```Step-by-Step DNS Configuration Process for Multiple Domain Providers
Here's a detailed walkthrough for configuring DNS records for your domains across different providers:

For GoDaddy Domains (namastemississauga.com)
Login to GoDaddy

Go to godaddy.com
Click "Sign In" and enter your credentials
Access Domain Management

After logging in, go to "My Products"
Find and select the domain namastemississauga.com
Navigate to DNS Settings

Look for "DNS" or "Manage DNS" option
Click on it to access the DNS management interface
Add A Record for Root Domain

Find the "Records" or "DNS Records" section
Click "Add" or "Add Record"
Select record type: A
For "Host" or "Name": enter @ (or sometimes left blank)
For "Points to" or "Value": enter 20.81.242.18
TTL: Select 1 hour (or 3600 seconds)
Save the record
Add CNAME Record for WWW

Click "Add" or "Add Record" again
Select record type: CNAME
For "Host" or "Name": enter www
For "Points to" or "Value": enter namastemississauga.com
TTL: Select 1 hour (or 3600 seconds)
Save the record
For Your Other Domain Provider (namastemississauga.ca)
Login to the Domain Registrar

Go to your registrar's website where namastemississauga.ca is registered
Sign in with your credentials
Find Domain Management

Navigate to domain management section
Select namastemississauga.ca from your domains list
Access DNS Settings

Look for "DNS Management", "DNS Settings", or "Zone Editor"
This might be under "Advanced Settings" in some providers
Add A Record for Root Domain

Find "Add Record" or "Create Record" button
Select A record type
Host/Name: @ or leave blank (represents root domain)
Value/Points to: 20.81.242.18
TTL: 3600 seconds (1 hour)
Save changes
Add CNAME Record for WWW

Click "Add Record" again
Select CNAME record type
Host/Name: www
Value/Points to: namastemississauga.ca
TTL: 3600 seconds (1 hour)
Save changes
After Configuration
Verify Records

Most providers show a summary of DNS records
Confirm both the A record and CNAME record appear correctly
Wait for Propagation

DNS changes typically take 15 minutes to 48 hours to fully propagate
You can check propagation using tools like dnschecker.org
Test the Domains

After propagation, verify that both domains resolve to your server by pinging them:
The response should show your server IP (20.81.242.18)
Run Certbot for SSL

Once DNS is properly configured, run:
Verify HTTPS Access

Visit all domains using https:// to confirm SSL is working properly
This process ensures your domains will point to your server and that SSL certificates will be correctly issued for secure connections.```
